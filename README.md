# NeoVim Configuration

## ToDo list:
    * From ChristianChiarulli general/functions.vim (spellcheck for .md)
    * Which key? Is a good pluggin to remember what and how to do smg 
    * Maybe comment to leader + /
    * How to make this configuration intallable?
    * Debugger
    * SSH with configuration
    * Change to Lua, new implementation of pluggins
    * My own pluggin, maybe a calendar, music pentagram, or voice recording reader.
